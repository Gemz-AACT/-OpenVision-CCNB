This project involved the technical and methodological approach to replace the existing PRTG monitoring solution with an open-source supervision platform at CCNB. The primary goal was to enhance the monitoring of IT infrastructure by ensuring the availability, performance, and reliability of critical services.

The main objective was to migrate to a robust, scalable, and license-free solution capable of supervising over 1,000 sensors distributed across various services, including Wi-Fi, WAN, VPN, firewalls, and servers. The project covered technology selection, installation, configuration, and integration phases. Additionally, real-time data visualization dashboards were developed using Grafana to improve data accessibility and operational insight.
